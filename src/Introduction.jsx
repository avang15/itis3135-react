          Hi, I am Aiden! I am studying Computer Science with a concentration in
          Cybersecurity. I was born and raised in Charlotte and attended the
          early college here at UNC Charlotte. In my free time, I enjoy
          listening to music, playing piano, and trying new food.

            grew up just down the road from campus. I am the oldest of two

            college directly after high school.
